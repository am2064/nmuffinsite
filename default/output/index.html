<p>Welcome to NaughtyMuffin MUSH, a somewhat whimsical and sexual game with a touch of BDSM. No real theme, no plot, just naughty stuff all the time! All characters are allowed -- anime, video game, TV, whatever you want! We can even have more than one of each character here! If you&#39;re trying to come up with an explanation for why an aspect of the Naughty Village is the way it is, you&#39;re thinking too hard!</p>
<p>Features certain coded systems for bondage-related phenomena, as well as Predicaments, which Doms (i.e. those who are Dominant in the BDSM scale) can use to do naughty things to their Subs (who are set Submissive). Also includes a Slave class, allowing further control.  It&#39;s not mandatory, and you can set yourself Switch to ignore the BDSM aspects entirely! All genders welcome, whether male, female, or hermaphrodite, so ... welcome to NaughtyMuffin MUSH!</p>
<p>We are currently in need of people whose preference is for males, gay or bisexual males, and female characters who are both not strictly dominant and whose preferences include males (other than girly ones).  We&#39;re not going to actually turn you down if you&#39;re not, though!</p>
